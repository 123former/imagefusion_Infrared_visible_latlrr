# Infrared and visible image fusion using Latent Low-Rank Representation

## Abstract

Infrared and visible image fusion is an important problem in the field of image fusion, and has been applied widely in many fields. 

To better preserve the useful information from infrared and visible images, in this paper, we propose a novel image fusion method based on latent low-rank representation (LatLRR) which is simple and effective. 

This is the first time that the LatLRR is introduced to infrared and visible image fusion. Firstly, the source images are decomposed into low-rank part and saliency part by LatLRR. The global structure information is preserved by low-rank part, and the local structure information is extracted by saliency part. Then, the low-rank parts are fused by weighted-average strategy, and the saliency parts are simply fused by sum strategy. Finally, the fused image is obtained by combining the fused low-rank part and the fused saliency part. 

Compared with other fusion methods experimentally, the proposed method has better fusion performance than the state of the art fusion methods in both subjective and objective evaluation.
